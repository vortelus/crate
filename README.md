# ðŸ“¦ Crate Protocol

![Crate Protocol](/images/banner.png)

Crate Protocol allows anyone to create, manage, and trade a tokenized basket of assets, which we refer to as a **Crate**. A Crate is always fully collateralized by its underlying assets. The protocol will evolve to support advanced features, including automatic rebalancing based on set parameters.
